The mini-ImageNet dataset was proposed by Vinyals et al. for few-shot learning evaluation.
Its complexity is high due to the use of ImageNet images but requires fewer resources and
infrastructure than running on the full ImageNet dataset. In total, there are 100 classes 
with 600 samples of 84Ã—84 color images per class.
